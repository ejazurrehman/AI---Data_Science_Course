    "# Factors and Multiples in Data Science\n",
    "- factors and multiples seem like basic school-level math (e.g., factors of 12 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12). But in data science, these concepts play useful roles in algorithms, optimization, cryptography, and computation efficiency.\n",
    "---\n",
    "### 1. Cryptography & Data Security (Number Theory Application):\n",
    "- Modern encryption methods (RSA, ECC) rely on the difficulty of factoring very large numbers.\n",
    "- Factors: Hard to compute for huge numbers → forms the basis of encryption strength.\n",
    "- Multiples: Used in modular arithmetic for encryption/decryption.\n",
    "- Example: RSA encryption works because factoring a product of two large primes is computationally difficult.\n",
    "### 2. Data Partitioning & Batch Processing:\n",
    "- When dividing large datasets for parallel processing, factors help split data into equal parts.\n",
    "- Multiples help in deciding batch sizes or window sizes for data processing.\n",
    "- Example: If you have 1,000,000 rows, choosing a batch size of 2,500 (a factor) makes it easier to divide the dataset evenly across processors.\n",
    "### 3. Hashing & Indexing in Databases:\n",
    "- Hash functions often use modulo operations (related to multiples and factors).\n",
    "- A prime factor as the modulo base improves data distribution in hash tables.\n",
    "- Example: A hash table with size 101 (a prime number) avoids clustering and distributes data more evenly than size 100.\n",
    "### 4. Fourier Transform & Signal Processing:\n",
    "- Data science (especially in image/audio analysis) uses Fourier transforms.\n",
    "- Factors of sequence length (e.g., powers of 2) determine how efficiently FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) runs.\n",
    "- Example: An FFT runs fastest when the data length is a multiple of 2 (like 256, 512, 1024).\n",
    "### 5. Optimization Problems:\n",
    "- Some data science problems (scheduling, supply chain, resource allocation) use Least Common Multiple (LCM) or Greatest Common Factor (GCF) for optimization.\n",
    "- Example: If two machines run on cycles of 12 minutes and 18 minutes, LCM = 36 → tells when both will be free together, useful in production scheduling.\n",
    "### 6. Random Number Generation & Sampling:\n",
    "- Many random number generators rely on modulus arithmetic.\n",
    "- Choosing good factors/multiples prevents repetitive cycles.\n",
    "- Example: Linear Congruential Generator (LCG)."
